**ManagedITK** generates wrappers for .NET languages around [ITK (The Insight Toolkit)](http://www.itk.org).

These wrappers can be used with any CLR language, including:
  * C#
  * VB.NET
  * C++/CLI
  * IronPython
  * Chrome
  * and others.

ManagedITK is useful for a number of reasons, but mainly for the ability to rapidly create image processing applications with graphical user interfaces using Windows Forms (also known as System.Windows.Forms).

For wrapping of other languages (such as python and Java) please see [WrapITK](http://code.google.com/p/wrapitk/).

In short: ManagedITK makes (medical) image processing in C# easy!

**IMPORTANT:** ManagedITK is no longer under active development. The next version of ITK (version 4) may eventually include internal support for C# wrapping, making ManagedITK unnecessary. For the moment the best way to use ITK from C# is via the SimpleITK C# wrappers found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/simpleitk/files/SimpleITK/0.4.0/CSharp
